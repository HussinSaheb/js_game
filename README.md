Skribble is a game I developed using agile methodologies over two sprints. It is meant to demonstrate and cement the technical knowledge acquired whilst training to become a consultant at Sparta global.

## Functionality

Skribbl is a game that's played by two or more players. One of the players will be given a word that they have to sketch on a canvas. The other player(s), must guess what the drawing is, if they guess correctly the player gets assigned points. If the time runs out and no guesses.The game will assign a new word and a different player will be assigned the role to draw. The game ends after 2 rounds of sketches per player, the player with the highest score wins.
